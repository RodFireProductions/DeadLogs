Current themes:
- Webcomic:
	Look into possible comment plugin sites to recommend.

Possible future themes:
- Terminal: 
	Include different color options.
- Bubbly:
	Include different color options.
- Old School:
	Use 98.css or a version of it to style everything.

Possibly make versions with two to three columns instead of just one?
