    This array is very important when it comes to the navigation between
    each post.

    **ANYTIME** you add a new page to your comic/book/zine, please add the file
    location to the *bottom* of whichever chapter you're in. This will keep the
    posts linked together in the right order.

    **Goes first to last from top to bottom.**
